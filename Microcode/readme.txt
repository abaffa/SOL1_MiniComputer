Welcome to Sol-OS 0.1, an operating system for the Sol-1 Homebrew-CPU minicomputer.\n\nThis operating system is being written from scratch and although it may look like it, it is not Unix/Linux/Minix.\nI am writing the system from scratch and I am trying to make it compatible with Unix.\nIt is still very early days however, so the system is very basic and primitive.\n\nYou can navigate around the file system, create and manage files and run programs.\n\nFor the "ls" command, directories are shown starting with a "d" to make them easier to recognize.\n\rTo run an executable program, type "./<filename>". Executables usually have no file extension here. To list a text file, type "cat <filename>".\n\n\nThank you for visiting, and don't forget to sign the guestbook!
