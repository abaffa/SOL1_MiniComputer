Sol-1 MiniComputer

A complete CPU and Minicomputer built from scratch in 74HC logic.

The hardware is 99% finished and small extra features may be added in the future.

The software however is in its very early stages and I am slowly writing a Unix-like operating system for this.


Inspired by Bill Buzbee's masterpiece, the Magic-1 Minicomputer.
